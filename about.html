<p style=margin-top:50px;>Teo Suzuki was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts and raised in Montclair, New Jersey. He graduated from the School of Visual Arts with a BFA in Comics, 
  and currently lives in Washington Heights. Suzuki is the co-founder of the independent comics collective <a href="https://epicwaynepress.neocities.org/">Epic Wayne Press</a>, 
  and has represented the group at shows, festivals, and expositions across the United States and Canada. While also an illustrator, Suzuki primarily considers himself a cartoonist, 
  consistently self-publishing mini-comics every year. His work unapologetically operates under the “furry” subgenre, while taking influence from classic alternative comics in hopes 
  of creating original, daring graphic storytelling.</p>
